it's shopping app made with react js

Welcome to the shopping app by react!

This app allows users to browse and purchase products from a virtual store. It is built using the React JavaScript library for the frontend, and a backend server for handling the data and processing the orders.

To get started, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can then clone this repository and run the following commands to install the required dependencies and start the app:

    npm install
    npm start

The app will be running on http://localhost:3000/ in your web browser.

You can browse through the available products, add them to your cart, and proceed to checkout to complete your purchase. The app also includes a user authentication system, so you can create an account and save your favorite products and previous orders.

Thank you for using the shopping app by react! We hope you have a great shopping experience.
